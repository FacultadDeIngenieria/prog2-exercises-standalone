# Inheritance

You have two jobs:

- Create the 4 required subclasses from the `Shape` class:
  - `Circle`
  - `Triangle`
  - `Rectangle`
  - `Square`
  
- Define the algorithms for:
  - Calculating the total area from a list of shapes
  - Calculating the min area from a list of shapes
  - Calculating the max area from a list of shapes
  - Calculate the total length of all perimeters from a list of shapes
  - Calculate the max length of all perimeters from a list of shapes
  - Calculate the min length of all perimeters from a list of shapes


_hint: square is a special case of rectangle, so it can have rectangle as a superclass._
